Note: the fractional Fourier transform demodulates the chirp signal and compares the demodulation performance of the matched filter

(Fractional Fourier transform of the chirp signal is demodulated, and the demodulation performance

(Multiple Frequency Shift Keying) mfsk



Multi band frequency shift keying (MFSK) is a modulation method that can use multiple different carrier frequencies to represent a variety of digital information

CBOK, chirp Bok, based on good autocorrelation of forward and reverse chirp pulses

And the sharp time-domain characteristics after matched filtering, linear frequency modulation pulse spread spectrum technology is used in high-speed

The ultra wideband wireless communication system based on chirp Bok modulation is designed



WML_ BOK_ pipei. Txt (bit error rate data) is CBOK_ pipei. M generated

WML_ BOK_ frft. Txt (bit error rate data) is CBOK_ frft. M generated

CBOK_ frft. M called the function FRFT m



Bit error rate curve Jpg is BER_ CBOK_ Mfsk. M generated

Bit error rate curve of FRFT and matched filter demodulation_ This experiment -ok Jpg is BER_ frft_ Pipei. Generated by M (this is the graph used in the paper)



Mfsk_ frft. M can run, and the generated memory file is MFSK_ frft_ Ratio doesn't work out. Is it too much computation

Mfsk_ pipei. M can run, and the generated memory file is MFSK_ pipei. mat
